# KV3toJSON

So...
You're on a quest to understand the internals of DOTA2 and all of a sudden you're faced with this format called KeyValues3 ( https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dota_2_Workshop_Tools/KeyValues3 ). "Nice" you think to yourself, "it's very similar to JSON". So you start parsing it, at which point the true horror strikes...

This lib fixes that true horror and translates KV3 over to JSON.
Don't sweat.
